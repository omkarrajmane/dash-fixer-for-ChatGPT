# Privacy Policy for Em Dash Fixer for ChatGPT

**Last Updated:** Aug 4, 2025

Thank you for using "Em Dash Fixer for ChatGPT" (the "Extension"). This privacy policy is here to assure you that your data is safe because we do not collect any of it.

### 1. No Data Collection

The Extension does not collect, store, log, or share any personally identifiable information or any other user data. All functionality of the Extension is performed locally on your computer, within your browser.

- The Extension reads and modifies text content on `chat.openai.com` and `chatgpt.com` domains to replace em dashes (â€”) with hyphens (-).
- The Extension adds a button to the user interface that allows you to copy the modified text to your clipboard.

This processing is entirely client-side. No information about your conversations, your usage patterns, or any other data is ever transmitted to any external server.

### 2. Permissions

- **`clipboardWrite`**: This permission is required for the core "copy" feature of the Extension. It is only activated when you explicitly click the copy button. The Extension does not read from your clipboard.
- **Host Permissions (`*://chat.openai.com/*`, `*://chatgpt.com/*`)**: These permissions are required for the Extension to run on the intended websites. The Extension does not interact with any other websites you visit.

### 3. Open Source

The Extension is fully open-source. You are encouraged to review the code on our GitHub repository to verify its privacy and security practices: [https://github.com/omkarrajmane/dash-fixer-for-ChatGPT](https://github.com/omkarrajmane/dash-fixer-for-ChatGPT)
